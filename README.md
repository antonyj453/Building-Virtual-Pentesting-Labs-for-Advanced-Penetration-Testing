## Introducing Penetration Testing
In this chapter, we will discuss the role that pen testing plays in the professional
security testing framework. We will discuss the following topics:

* Define security testing
* An abstract security testing methodology
* Myths and misconceptions about pen testing

If you have been doing penetration testing for some time and are very familiar with
the methodology and concept of professional security testing, you can skip this
chapter, or just skim it, but you might learn something new or at least a different
approach to penetration testing.

#### Security testing

If you ask 10 consultants to define what security testing is today, you are more than
likely to get a variety of responses. If we refer to Wikipedia, their definition states:

"Security testing is a process to determine that an information system protects and
maintains functionality as intended."

In my opinion, this is the most important aspect of penetration testing. Security is
a process and not a product. I would also like to add that it is a methodology and
not a product.

Another component to add to our discussion is the point that security testing takes
into account the main areas of a security model; a sample of this is as follows:

* Authentication
* Authorization
* Confidentiality
* Integrity
* Availability
* Non-repudiation

Each one of these components has to be considered when an organization is in
the process of securing their environment. Each one of these areas in itself has
many subareas that also have to be considered when it comes to building a secure
architecture. The takeaway is that when we are testing security, we have to address
each of these areas.
