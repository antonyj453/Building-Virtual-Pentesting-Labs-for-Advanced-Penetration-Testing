## Introducing Penetration Testing
In this chapter, we will discuss the role that pen testing plays in the professional
security testing framework. We will discuss the following topics:

* Define security testing
* An abstract security testing methodology
* Myths and misconceptions about pen testing

If you have been doing penetration testing for some time and are very familiar with
the methodology and concept of professional security testing, you can skip this
chapter, or just skim it, but you might learn something new or at least a different
approach to penetration testing.
